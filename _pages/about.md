Hi, I'm Olga. 

I'm a computational research scientist in catalysis and material science. I study how data-driven methodologies impact the discovery, characterization, and engineering of new materials. I graduated with a PhD from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in 2021 in Chemical Engineering, where I worked on improving hydrogen fuel cell catalysts through first-principles simulation. Most recently I was a postdoc at the [Fritz Haber Instiute](https://www.fhi.mpg.de/th-department) of the Max Planck Society in Berlin, Germany researching carbon reaction catalysis. 

Iâ€™m passionate about how human interaction with practical datasets shapes the way we perceive and interact with the world. I'm excited by learning how the latest in emerging ML/AI technologies impacts real-world challenges in engineering, from energy storage storage to sustainable chemical production. 

Outside of work, I love solving and writing puzzlehunts. See the [puzzles](https://ovinogra.github.io/puzzles/) page for projects I've worked on. 

Outside of my virtual life I enjoy skiing, cardio kickboxing, and traditional square-rig tallship sailing (yes, like in pirate movies).
